dunno how 2 fix path traversal in 1.2 :C, possible solution is changing name of service script(such as 1.3) or storage folder, but that fails if there exists some way of finding out file/directory names(i will give candy to anyone who could do that!)

hidden exploit for 1.2 is the same as usual but it allows checker to use service as usual while simple exploit changes service code completely and corrupts it
